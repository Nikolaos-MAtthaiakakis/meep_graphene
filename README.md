# Scattering from graphene plasmonic nanoresonator
This is a coordinate transform example of scattering from a graphene plasmonic resonator with Ef=0.64 and Î¼=1000cm^2/V.s.

The resonator is a square with a size of 75nm*60nm and z=1/(resolution*stretch), giving a single pixel thickness after the coordinate transform. Detailed convergence testing hasn't been completed but the results for a thickness of 5nm (resolution=10, stretching=20, alpha=1um) are already very good.  

Please verify that your results are correct when using this code. As the author I claim no responsibility for any errors.
